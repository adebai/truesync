# truesync
A PHP 8.2 testing application for one-way file sync

# To run:
  
1. Edit .env
2. Add folders to watch into watcher.json
3. Open index.php in console/terminal. 

# Note:
1. Tests is empty, working on it.
2. It is capable of 2-way sync between personal devices, but because of the need for a middle agent, the functionality is yet to be developed.
